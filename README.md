# vim-framer-syntax

A straight rip of [Framer X's beautiful in-app editor](https://www.framer.com/development/). It's reasonably faithful to Framer's original color choices and where necessary, makes tweaks that benefit Vim (think extensions like [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) and [ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)) and non-JS based projects. It's built using [estilo](https://github.com/jacoborus/estilo). JavaScript was tuned against pangloss' [vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript).
